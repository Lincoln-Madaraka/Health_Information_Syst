# Health Information System

This project simulates a **basic Health Information System** where a doctor (system user) can:

- Create health programs (e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV, etc.)
- Register clients (patients)
- Enroll clients into one or multiple programs
- Search for registered clients
- View a client's profile and enrolled programs
- Expose client profiles through a simple **REST API**

> Developed as part of the **CEMA Software Engineering Internship Application Task**.

## Setup Instructions

🔹 To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HealthInformationSystem.git
cd HealthInformationSystem
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

3. **Install the dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run migrations**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Create a superuser (admin login)**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. **Start the development server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

7. **Access the app**
- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` on your browser.

## API Endpoints

🔹 A simple API is exposed to retrieve client profiles.

| Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `/api/clients/` | Returns a list of all registered clients and their enrolled programs in JSON format |

Example Output:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "programs": ["HIV Program", "Malaria Program"]
  },
  ...
]
```

> 🔥 **API-first Approach:** The API is designed to be easily extendable for future systems integration.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on **Render** for easy access.  

Deployment steps:
1. Pushed to GitHub.
2. Connected GitHub repository to Render.
3. Configured **Procfile** and **vercel.json**.
4. Automatic deploy on `git push`.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for all major models and views.
- Improve the API (pagination, authentication).
- Add detailed client histories and appointment scheduling.
- Implement security features (user authentication, access roles).
- Optimize database queries and indexes for large datasets.
- Deploy using a production-grade database like PostgreSQL.
